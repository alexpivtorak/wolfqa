const badActions: Action[] = [
    { type: 'navigate', text: 'http://example.com' },
    { type: 'wait', duration: 1000 }, // Should be removed
    { type: 'type', selector: '#input', text: 'Wolf' },
    { type: 'type', selector: '#input', text: 'Wolf' }, // Identical - should be removed
    { type: 'click', selector: '#btn', reason: 'Submit' },
    { type: 'fail', reason: 'panic' }, // Should be removed
    { type: 'click', selector: '#btn', reason: 'Submit' }, // Not consecutive with previous click due to fail, but let's see. 
    // Actually, fail is removed first? Loop logic:
    // next = actions[i+1]. If fail is at i, we skip.
    // If we have click, fail, click.
    // i=click. next=fail. Identity check? No. Keep click.
    // i=fail. skip.
    // i=click. keep.
    // Result: click, click.

    // Wait, let's look at the implementation of Optimizer again.
    // It creates a new array.
    // It iterates `actions`. 
    // If `current` is wait/fail, continue (skip).
    // If `next` matches `current`, skip `current`.

    // Test case: consecutive identical actions
    { type: 'scroll', reason: 'bottom' },
    { type: 'scroll', reason: 'bottom' }, // Should be removed
    { type: 'done' }
];

// Expected: navigate, type, click, click (because fail was between them, so they weren't consecutive in the RAW stream? 
// WAIT. The optimizer loop looks at `actions[i]` and `actions[i+1]`.
// If `actions[i+1]` is 'fail', it hasn't been removed yet.
// So `areActionsIdentical(click, fail)` is false.
// So `click` is kept.
// Then `fail` is visited and skipped.
// Then valid `click` is visited.
// So we get `click`, `click`.
// This reveals a flaw or feature? If there was a fail in between, maybe it WASN't a panic loop in the same second, but a retry?
// But `Optimizer` is for "Golden Path". We probably want to dedupe even if there was noise.
// BUT, my current implementation only looks at immediate neighbor in source array.
// For now, let's verify it works for immediate neighbors which is the "WolfWolf" case (type, type).
